My solutions from the Little Schemer.  Mostly straight from the book,
though my functions may vary slightly in naming and implementation.  I
also may have skipped some functions, I'm mostly uploading these for my
own sake, people looking for exact solutions will probably find this
repo much more useful: https://github.com/pkrumins/the-little-schemer

I'll add my code for The Seasoned Schemer as I work through it later.
